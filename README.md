# College Tracker 
MERN Stack app that keeps track of college application information. 
This application is uses code from Brad Traversy's mern_shopping_list repository as a starting point. 
The app was built with the MERN stack and implements Redux for state management.
Reactstrap and react-transition-group were used for the front-end client side development. 

## Heroku 
The app is deployed on my heroku server, here's the link: https://pacific-dusk-74714.herokuapp.com/
