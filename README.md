# College Tracker 
MERN Stack app that keeps track of college application information. 
This application is based off of Brad Traversy's mern_shopping_list repository. 
The app was built with the MERN stack and implements Redux for state management.
Reactstrap and react-transition-group were used for the front-end client side development.
