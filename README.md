# College Tracker 

## SUMMARY
This project is built off of Brad Traversys MERN stack application in his youtube tutorial. I modified this into a MERN stack application  to help high school students keep track of their college application information. A person can input information like the decision on their application, the deadline for the application, and other notes.

Working on this side project was more for me to learn more about the MERN stack. Although I have both front-end and back-end development experience I never worked on a project where I had to encorporate them both. This helped me get more familiar with state management and connecting the front-end UI to the back-end database.
